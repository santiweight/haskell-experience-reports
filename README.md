This repo tracks the WIP for Haskell Experience Reports (name suggestions welcome). Literally everything is up for feedback right now; issues or MRs are encouraged.

## Ways to help
 - **Provide feedback on the format and content of the example experience report**. Note there are comments in the actual markdown text!
 - **Be a production company willing to work on an experience report with me**.
 - **Pressure your friends to get involved**. Haskell can be a very vocal minority community - but it starts by making sure we all shout loudly :)

**Go pester your production-Haskell friends!** It makes our language look legit when non-Haskellers see us _do_ _stuff_ with it.

## Background
 - The original [Haskell Experience Reports RFC on discourse](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/rfc-haskell-in-production-experience-reports/4285)
 - The original discussion "[I feel like Haskell is dying](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/i-feel-like-haskell-is-dying/4180/118)" that prompted the idea.
