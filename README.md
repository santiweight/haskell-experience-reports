This repo tracks the WIP for Haskell Experience Reports (name suggestions welcome). Literally everything is up for feedback right now. Ways you can help:
 - Provide feedback on the format and content of the current example experience report. Note that the example report is completely made up - you are welcome to suggest any changes
 - Be a production company willing to work on an experience report with me. Please contact me on reddit under u/santiweight, github, or discourse with username santiweight
 - Pressure your friends to get involved. I think Haskell can be a very vocal minority community - but it starts by making sure we all shout loudly :)
 - Help me out with integrating with the Hakyll website code for the Haskell Foundation (future work)

Go pester your production Haskell friends! It makes our language look legit when non-Haskellers see us _do_ _stuff_ with it.

Background:
 - The original [Haskell Experience Reports RFC on discourse](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/rfc-haskell-in-production-experience-reports/4285)
 - The original discussion "[I feel like Haskell is dying](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/i-feel-like-haskell-is-dying/4180/118)" that prompted the idea.
