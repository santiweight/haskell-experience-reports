This repo tracks the WIP for Haskell Experience Reports (name suggestions welcome). Literally everything is up for feedback right now; issues or MRs are encouraged.

## Guide

  1. Optional: start with the principles.md to get a feeling for Haskell Report's intent and tone.
  2. Then start reading the example.md report. Note that there are **comments in the markdown** that explain each section etc.
  3. Write your own report with the help of submit_report.md (TODO).

## Ways to help
 - **Provide feedback on the format and content of the example experience report**. *Note there are comments in the actual markdown text!*
 - **Be a production company willing to work on an experience report with me**.
 - **Pressure your friends to get involved**.

## Origins of Haskell Reports
 - The original [Haskell Experience Reports RFC on discourse](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/rfc-haskell-in-production-experience-reports/4285)
 - The original discussion "[I feel like Haskell is dying](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/i-feel-like-haskell-is-dying/4180/118)" that prompted the idea.
