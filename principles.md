## Audience

The target audience will be non-technical non-Haskellers. The reports should exclude as few readers as possible and the reports should be able to communicate the value of Haskell whilst keeping technical details to a minimum.

The most important reader is the reader who is deciding on whether to allow someone to use Haskell in production, such as non-technical manager or CEO. Your report can very concretely influence the real-world adoption of Haskell.

## Who can write a report

Anyone can write the reports, but credibility is really helpful, so author background, such as non-Haskell experience, really make a report _pop_. If possible, get your experienced manager to sign off their name as a co-author!

The "ideal" author might have some of these features:

 - Senior engineer with 5+ years industry experience
 - 3+ years of non-Haskell experience (this can be very helpful!)
 - A manager who has managed a non-Haskell project for 2+ years
 - An experienced engineer person for whom this project was their first Haskell experience (if they were skeptical even better!)

## Voice

The voice is first person plural. The speaker is the entire team, from the perspective of a manager or tech lead:

> We first adopted Haskell at ACME in 2018 as part of a rewrite of a 10 year C++ codebase.

## Tone

Reports should use a formal (not dry - a joke is okay) tone. The author should write value-oriented judgments of Haskell's indsutry viability, even when judging social/emotional metrics (such as engineering happiness).

For example, instead of, “I really liked using lens - it was fun and made waking up easier”, a better tone would be, “We found that lens had the benefit of improving engineer morale, who reported that working on the code base was more motivating and exciting as a direct result of using it”.

Remember: you are trying to target non-technical non-Haskellers; try to speak their language when you can...
